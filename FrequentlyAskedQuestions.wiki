== Can I use Dependency Injection (Spring, Guice, Weld) with Objectify? ==
Yes!  Objectify was designed with this in mind.
  # Ignore the {{{ObjectifyService}}} class and its static methods.  It is merely a static proxy for a single instance of {{{ObjectifyFactory}}}.  Instead you will use {{{ObjectifyFactory}}} directly.
  # Create an application-scoped {{{ObjectifyFactory}}} instance, register your classes, and inject it!
  # Alternatively, use the DAO pattern (see BestPractices) and inject your DAO.

== How do I shut off the datanucleus byte code enhancer? ==
  * In Eclipse, go to the Project Properties -> Builders and disable the Enhancer.

== How can I integrate with memcached? ==
  * A simple [IntroductionToObjectify#Caching write-through cache] will be integrated into Objectify for 2.0 final.
  * Until then, you can use [http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-java/msg/ca9a275cc48858ba CachingDatastoreService], but beware: it has issues with transactions.  Simply extend {{{ObjectifyFactory}}} and override the {{{getDatastoreService()}}} method.
