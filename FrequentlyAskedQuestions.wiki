= Frequently Asked Questions =

== Can I use Dependency Injection (Spring, Guice, Weld) with Objectify? ==
Yes!  Objectify was designed with this in mind.
  # Ignore the {{{ObjectifyService}}} class and its static methods.  It is merely a static proxy for a single instance of {{{ObjectifyFactory}}}.  Instead you will use {{{ObjectifyFactory}}} directly.
  # Create an application-scoped {{{ObjectifyFactory}}} instance, register your classes, and inject it!
  # Alternatively, use the DAO pattern (see BestPractices) and inject your DAO.

== How do I shut off the datanucleus byte code enhancer? ==
  * In Eclipse, go to the Project Properties -> Builders and disable the Enhancer.

== Can I change data after it is loaded or before it is stored? ==
Absolutely:
  * See the [http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/IntroductionToObjectify#Lifecycle_Callbacks Lifecycle Callbacks]

== Should I Use a String (Name) Id? ==
If it is a natural key, sure; Objectify allows this no problem. Here is a little more of a discussion [http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-java/browse_thread/thread/998289f853f5a688/c50446d98eb90017?#c50446d98eb90017 about it.]

== How can I integrate with memcached? ==
  * See the [http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/IntroductionToObjectify#Caching Caching] documentation. Hint, add @Cached to your (entity) class.

== How do I do a like query (LIKE "foo%") ==

You can do something like a startWith, or endWith if you reverse the order when stored and searched. You do a range query with the starting value you want, and a value just above the one you want.

{{{
String start = "foo";
... = ofy.query(MyEntity.class).filter("field >=", start).filter("field <", start + "\uFFFD"); 
}}}

== How do I migrate from JDO to Objectify? ==
You should have no trouble using Objectify side-by-side with JDO.
Just don't use the javax.persistence.Entity annotation on Objectify
entities, it will likely make the JDO bytecode enhancer try to enhance
it. Don't use an annotation if you don't need to name your entity something different than the classname.

For the most part, migrating JDO classes to Objectify classes should
be pretty straightforward.  The only trick will be mapping the
relationships.  Look at the raw Entity objects to see what structure
JDO created - relationships are just a Key on one end or both.  If you
make this field a Key<?> (or Collection<Key<?>>) in your Objectify
entities, it will map just fine.

== Does Objectify support JDO Fetch Groups? ==

There is no such thing as a fetch group in the GAE datastore; entities
are fetched in their entirety or not at all.  Objectify reflects the
underlying nature of the datastore so it does not require this
JDO-ism.

== Does Objectify support JDO detach copy? ==

There is no need for this JDO-ism either.  Objectify entities are
exactly as you define them.  They are not bytecode-enhanced, proxied,
or manipulated in any way.  Want to serialize your entity?  Just make
sure it is Serializable.

== Can I use Spring to automatically register entities? ==

Yes you can, see the [http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine-spring/ objectify-appengine-spring] project.

== Can I mix Low Level and Objectify writes in a single Objectify transaction? ==

Example...

{{{
Objectify ofy = ObjectifyService.beginTransaction()

ofy.put( makeSomeObject() )
ofy.getDatastore().put( makeSomeLowLevelEntity() )

ofy.getTxn().commit()
}}}

Yes you can! With a few caveats...

  * You're still limited by GAE's restrictions on transactions (namely, all objects must be part of the same entity group).
  * If you have session caching enabled, the direct-datastore put() will bypass the session cache.  If the session cache already held a value for that key, subsequent a get() from the Objectify instance will produce the (now incorrect) cached value.
  * The global cache will remain consistent as long as you obtain the DatastoreService from ofy.getDatastore(); if you get it directly from DatastoreServiceFactory it will bypass Objectify's global (memcache) cache.

But yeah, you're free to interleave Objectify and Low-Level API calls.
