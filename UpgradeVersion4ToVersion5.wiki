#summary How To Upgrade Objectify v4 To v5

= Upgrading =

Objectify v5 brings two major changes:

 * The native storage format for embedded objects has changed from dot-separated property names to the new {{{EmbeddedEntity}}} native structure.
 * The code that translates back and forth between POJOs and native data structures has been rewritten from scratch.

This allows Objectify to offer great new features like polymorphism and lifecycle methods in embedded objects. However, it may require to migrate the structure of existing data.

= Incredibly Important Migration Instructions =

*IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!*

If you have used {{{@Embed}}} to store data with previous versions of Objectify, and you do not follow these instructions, *you will lose data*. Furthermore, once you have followed these instructions, *you cannot rollback to a previous version of Objectify* or your data will be lost. If you have not used {{{@Embed}}}, the migration is unnecessary.
